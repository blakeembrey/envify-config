# envify-config

A simple module that combines the [envify](https://npmjs.org/package/envify) and [config](https://npmjs.org/package/config) modules for Browserify process configuration.

## Why?

Building modules that are intended to be browserified means you need to add the required transforms to the `package.json`. However, using this configuration only allows us to set the modules to use for the transforms.
